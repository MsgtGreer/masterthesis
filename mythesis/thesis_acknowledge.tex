At first, I would like to thank Prof. Bernhard Ketzer for the opportunity to work on this topic. I really enjoyed my work in his group.\\
There are a lot of other people that for whose support I am very grateful.
Thanks to Dima Schaab, who always had an ear for my problems. Dima had to deal with the most stupid questions and did this patiently.\\
Many thanks go to Dr. Christian Honisch for a lot of useful tips. He helped me out when I almost gave up on my prototype.\\
Thanks to Max Loepke for helping me out with my caffeine addiction over the past year.\\
I would not have made it through university without Backfisch, thank you people.\\

Last, but definitely not least, I want to thank my beloved fiancée.
