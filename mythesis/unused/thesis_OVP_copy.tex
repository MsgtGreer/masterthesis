\chapter{Over voltage protection}
\label{sec:OVP}
%==============================================================================
\section{Intro}
Operational Amplifiers have a normal Range of operation from the naegative to positive suplly voltage. If the voltage on one of the inputs exceeds this, the opAmp isin danger of destruction.

\section{Issues with the old setup}

\section{Diode clamping}
To prevent such an event, there is a commonly used practice of so called "diode clamping".

Two Diodes connected to the supply voltages. If now the Voltage on the input exceeds the suplly voltage more than the typical 0.7 V forward voltage of a diode the diode shorts the input to the suplly and the input is safe.

Challange now is to find diodes with a reasonable low leakage current. 

\section{the leakage current of diodes}
The leakage current of a diode is the current that is runing when we backward bias the diode.
I conducted an experiment to measure the leakage current of different diode types.
Add schematic here. 


\section{advanced clamping}
To protect the overall circutry, mostly the adc here, i wanted \footnote{Christian Honisch played a great part here} to extend the ovp to voltages within (-1.5,1.5) V.
This is done by adding additional reference voltages to the board. there for two voltage regulators were included.
